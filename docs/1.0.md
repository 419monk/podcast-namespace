# RSS Namespace Extension for Podcast

A wholistic RSS namespace for podcasting that is meant to synthesize the fragmented world of podcast namespaces. The broad goal is to create one namespace to rule them all, that is easily extensible, community controlled/authored and addresses the needs of the independent podcast industry now and in the future. The large podcast platforms have shown virtually no interest in extending their namespaces for new functionality in many years. Our hope is that this namespace will become the framework that the independent podcast community needs to deliver new functionality to apps and aggregators.
# Podcast Tags
Each tag below exists in the podcast namespace within the specified parent. All attributes are required unless explicitly specified as optional.

## Transcript
`<podcast:transcript>`
This tag is used to link to a transcript or closed captions file. Multiple tags can be present for multiple transcript formats.

#### Parent
`<item>`

#### Attributes
**url:** URL of the podcast transcript

**type:** Mime type of the file such
as `text/plain`, `text/html`, `application/srt`, `application/json`

**language (optional):** The language of the linked transcript. If there is no language attribute given, the linked file is assumed to be the same language that is
specified by the RSS `<language>` element.

**rel (optional):** If the rel="captions" attribute is present, the linked file is considered to be a closed captions file, regardless of what the mime type is.  In that scenario, time codes are assumed to be present in the file in some capacity.

#### Examples
`<podcast:transcript url="https://podcastindex.org/ep0002/transcript.html" type="text/html" />`

`<podcast:transcript url="https://podcastindex.org/ep0002/transcript.srt" type="text/srt" rel="captions" />`

`<podcast:transcript url="https://podcastindex.org/ep0002/transcript.json" type="application/json" language="es" rel="captions" />`

## Locked
`<podcast:locked>`
This tag may be set to `yes` or `no`. The purpose is to tell other podcast platforms whether they are allowed to import this feed. A value of `yes` means that any attempt to import this feed into a new platform should be rejected. It is expected that podcast hosting providers will enable a toggle in their GUI to allow their users to turn feed transfer lock on or off.
#### Parent
`<channel>`

#### Attributes
**owner:** The owner attribute is an email address that can be used to verify ownership of this feed during move and import operations. This could be a public email or a virtual email address at the hosting provider that redirects to the owner's true email address. This is a critical element, and it's expected that podcast hosting providers (if not providing virtual addresses) will allow setting this element's value in their GUI with an emphasis to their users of how important it is to have this be a valid, working email address.

#### Examples
`<podcast:locked owner="email@domain.com">yes</podcast:locked>`

`<podcast:locked owner="email@domain.com">no</podcast:locked>`

## Funding
`<podcast:funding>`
This tag lists possible donation/funding links for the podcast. The content of the tag is the recommended string to be used with the link
#### Parent
`<channel>`

#### Attributes
**url:** The URL to be followed to fund the podcast.

**platform (optional)** Identifies a payment or funding platform for the podcast. Service slugs should be recorded here in the repository.

#### Examples
`<podcast:funding url="www.mydomain.com/support">Support the show!</podcast:funding>`

`<podcast:funding platform="paypal" url="www.paypal.me/myshow">Support the show!</podcast:funding>`
